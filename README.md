# Introduction 
The MIMI project is developing and validating an index for risk of inadequate
micronutrient intake and applying machine learning to predict this sub nationally
in India, Ethiopia and Nigeria. The ultimate aim of MIMI will be to apply 
these methods to predict the index in countries that do not currently have good 
data systems to inform LSFF decisions.

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
